In this Chapter we study the nucleation process of the colloidal Laves phase by means of numerical simulations. Although Laves phases have been proven to be  stable in a binary hard-sphere system, they have never been observed to spontaneously crystallise in a binary fluid in  simulations nor in experiments of  micron-sized hard spheres due to slow dynamics. Here we demonstrate, using computer simulations, that softness in the interparticle potential suppresses  the degree of fivefold symmetry  in the binary fluid phase and enhances crystallisation of Laves phases in nearly hard spheres.
