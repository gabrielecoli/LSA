In this Chapter we investigate  binary nucleation  of the AB13 crystal from a binary fluid phase of nearly-hard spheres. We calculate the nucleation barrier and nucleation rate as a function of supersaturation and draw a comparison with nucleation of  single component and other binary crystals. To follow the nucleation process, we employ a neural network to identify the AB13 phase from the binary fluid phase and the competing fcc crystal with single-particle resolution and significant accuracy in the case of bulk phases. We show that AB13 crystal nucleation  proceeds via a co-assembly process where large spheres and icosahedral small-sphere clusters simultaneously attach to the nucleus. Our results lend strong support for a classical pathway that is well-described by classical nucleation theory,  even though the binary fluid phase is highly structured and exhibit local regions of high bond orientational order.
