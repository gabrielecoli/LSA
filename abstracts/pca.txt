In this Chapter we analyse the problem of finding an order parameter for classifying the polymorphs appearing during a crystal nucleation event of hard spheres. We discuss the limitations and shortcomings of many approaches in the literature, and propose a new unsupervised learning-based algorithm that combines speed of execution and interpretability, and contains a large amount of information. We finally demonstrate the effectiveness of this new order parameter by analysing hard-sphere nucleation trajectories and recognising the different polymorphs, as well as particles at the interface between the supersaturated fluid phase and the crystalline embryo.
