In this Chapter, we study the crystal nucleation of hard spheres for which, despite numerous experimental and theoretical studies, many aspects are far from being understood. We show that the excess of face-centred-cubic (fcc)-like particles with respect to hexagonal-close-packed (hcp)-like particles in a crystal nucleus of hard spheres as observed in simulations and  experiments can be explained by the higher order structure in the fluid phase. We show that, in the metastable fluid phase, fivefold symmetry clusters -- pentagonal bipyramids (PBs) -- known to be inhibitors of crystal nucleation, transform  into a different cluster -- Siamese dodecahedra (SDs). These clusters, because of their geometric arrangement, form a bridge between the fivefold symmetric fluid and the fcc crystal, thus lowering its  interfacial free energy  with respect to the hcp crystal, and shedding light on the polymorph selection mechanism.
