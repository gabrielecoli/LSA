# LSA
Latent Sentiment Analysis (LSA) to find similarities between different documents. To create an encoding of the documents, the term-frequency-inverse-document-frequency (tf-idf) algorithm is used, and the resulting matrix is used as input for the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm.

The whole code is in the LSA_with_SVD.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.
